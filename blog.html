        <div>
          <p>Nicola Tesla's life story is touching that, whenever I hear his name I feel wonder and sadness at the same time, always. firstly, his genius srprises me the most. Secondly, his personal life, especially how he lost everything at the end of his life. Especially his last letter to his mother iis so touching.</p>
